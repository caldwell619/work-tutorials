## Welcome

Now that that's over.

## TFS / Azure

We use [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) (commonly called TFS) for everything to do with work flows.

Git, deployment, build pipelines, boards, sprints, everything is managed on this locally hosted version of Azure.

### What to do about it

To access this, you need to be on the local intranet. That means either on the company internet ( wired or `SWBC Internal`) or through the use of a VPN.

You'll use your network credentials to log in to both the VPN, and the board.

### Board

This project is under Marketplace. To summarize, Marketplace provides mechanical warranties and GAP insurance through the sage of API's and their UI.

Buy Now's [board](http://p-apptfsalm1:8080/tfs/AppDevScrum/Marketplace/_boards/board/t/BuyNow%20Team/Backlog%20items) is under the Marketplace project family.

## AWS

This project uses [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). You'll have an account created for you under the project. In the mean time, it's a good idea to [create your own](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) as a playground.

__You need to provide a credit card for your own, so it's obviously optional.__

The [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) is extremely generous, so you won't have to pay anything to use it as a learning ground.
